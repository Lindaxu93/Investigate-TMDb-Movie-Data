# Investigate-TMDb-Movie-Data

I will be analysing the data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), there are twenty one colums, including user ratings, revenue, budget, genres, and director, etc.

● Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.

● There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. I leave them as is.

● The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation overtime.

Questions in this project:
